Z - redshifts
m_B magnitudes

Use the above two to get an estimate of how distant the supernovae is
They are all type 1A supernovae (they all occur at the same luminosity)
So we know how bright they should be and how bright they appear and we can use that to get an estimate of the distance

We want to convert from Z to some kind of distance. We'll make a redshift versus distance plot which is the diagonal line plot in the paper

This conversion will depend on cosmological parameters such as the speed of the expansion of the universe

If the universe is expanding very quickly, we'll see the light stretched out, which means there was less time between when it was emitted and when we saw it

Quick expansion means for a given redshift we expect a shorter distance

We need a model that takes in the data to get the relationship between redshift and distance
